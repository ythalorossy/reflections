How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can look only the changed code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see the improvement of the code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Autosave can generate unnecessary commits, making the story becomes very
    complex and meaningless

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git all history of versions. Using git diff is possible to compare two
    versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Well, when I use version control I can check errors in past versions. I can
     navigate inside those versions checking which version caused the problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git in my projects to make it versioned
